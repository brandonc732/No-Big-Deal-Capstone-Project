# No Big Deal Capstone Project
Project Title: **Improved Nanoparticle Size Posterior Estimation by Markov Chain Monte Carlo Inference with Location Error Characterization**

Team No Big Deal:
- Brandon Chestnut
- Soham Kapadia
- Aidan Shea
- Harshit Singh



# Getting Started

not allowed to upload NIST images. Have to input NIST images into test data folder



# Simulation notebooks



## Simulation.ipynb

Brandon's first attempt at creating a fitted simulation


## SimulationUpdate.ipynb

Harshit and Aidan's changes to improve original simulation notebook.

Describe changes made and how to run it since it's setup for google colab



# Folder Layout

Each folder includes its own readme describing its contents and purpose.

## Inference Layout

## beads

Contains all work done with beads.exe from [![DOI](https://img.shields.io/badge/DOI-10.1214%2F09--AOAS299-blue)](https://doi.org/10.1214/09-AOAS299)

Ultimately couldn't use it for the project. More detail in [beads readme](https://github.com/brandonc732/No-Big-Deal-Captsone-Project/blob/main/beads/readme.md)

## test data

location to insert test data from folder Dr. Pintar shared. Should include `Fluorescent_99_nm_polystyrene_in_saline` folder and `particle_tracking_video.avi` video

## anaconda environment

folder with yaml file for anaconda environment to run project.
