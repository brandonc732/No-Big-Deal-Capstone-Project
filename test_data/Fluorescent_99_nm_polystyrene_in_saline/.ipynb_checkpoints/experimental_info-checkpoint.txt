There are 150 fluorescence micrographs (in TIFF format) that show polystyrene 
nanoparticles diffusing in saline. The particles have a nominal diameter of 99
nanometers, the image pixel size is 314.3 nanometers, the time between 
micrographs is 100 milliseconds, the temperature is 23.4 C, and the viscosity
is of the saline solution is 9.2e-4 Pascal seconds.
